# Three.js Physics Demo

# Demo at -

---

## Features / What We've Learned

### 1. **Gravity, physics with bouncing objects**

- Rapier vs Cannon
- Structuring object creation
- Sync threejs meshes with rapier colliders

### 2. **[WIP] Web Workers to Spin Off CPU Threads**

- Work in Progress but the idea is to make a worker to just handle physics ( position, rotation etc ) and have the main thread just render objects inside the animation frame

## Issues / Todos

### 1. **Web Worker**
