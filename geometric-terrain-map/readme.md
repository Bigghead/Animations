# Three.js Physics Demo

# Demo at - https://hex-of-the-land.netlify.app/

Another one that looks simple, but needs more thought into to get running well

## Features

### 1. **Gradient Noise Procedural Terrain Mapping**

### 2. **InstancedMeshes for Performance**

## Issues / Todos

### 1. **More Performance**

- "My monitor has 240 hertz refresh and this only goes up to 160fps in Chrome". Yes, but I'm a noob and you're already getting 700+ meshes with everything having a shadow and that light refraction in the water. Can probably make the trees as instances to help a bit, but it's the shadows that are expensive here

### 2. **New Project Using This**

- You know what you're making ( another chatgpt wrapper lmaoooo ). Ok, but no
